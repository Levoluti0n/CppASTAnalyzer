## 🚀 Features

- **Lexer**: Breaks down source code into tokens. Identify keywords, operators, identifiers, and more! 🎉
- **Parser**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens, allowing for deeper code analysis. 🌳
- **AST Traversal**: Navigate through the AST and print its structure in a clear and concise manner. 🗺️
- **File Handling**: Easily read from and write to source code files, making it suitable for larger projects! 📁

## 🔍 How It Works

The **My Language Parser and Lexer** operates through a series of structured steps, allowing for efficient processing of source code. Here’s a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Tokenization**: 
   - The **lexer** scans the input text character by character.
   - It skips whitespace and identifies meaningful tokens, such as keywords, operators, identifiers, numbers, and delimiters.
   - Each identified token is stored in a list for further processing.

2. **Parsing**: 
   - The **parser** takes the list of tokens generated by the lexer.
   - It analyzes the tokens according to the grammatical rules defined for the language, building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the code, with nodes corresponding to constructs like classes, methods, variables, and operations.

3. **AST Traversal**: 
   - Once the AST is constructed, it can be traversed to analyze or manipulate the code structure.
   - The **ASTTraversal** class provides methods to navigate through the AST, allowing you to print its structure in a clear and concise manner.
   - This traversal can be used for tasks such as code analysis, transformations, or generating output based on the tree structure.

By combining these components, **My Language Parser and Lexer** efficiently transforms raw source code into a structured representation, enabling further processing and analysis.
